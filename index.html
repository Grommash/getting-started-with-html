  <br>
  HTML markup is made of tags<br>
  < NAME > CONTENTS < /NAME ><br>
    The content is surrounded by an opening and a closing tag. Each tag has a name that the sotware recognizes.<br> A slash is always in front of the closing tag. Some tags are <em>void tags</em> so they don`t require a closing tag.<br> The entire line can be called an element.<br>
    HTML tags are various and provide a vast array of options for users.<br>
    You can create invisible boxes to organise texts, add links, contain additional contents and so on.<br> The HTML document consists of <em>html tag</em> surrounding the whole document, the <em>head</em> which has meta-data,<br> the <em>title</em> and the body of the html.
